title: A Distributed Mentoring Movement
---

A few weeks ago I came across [Nick Disabato](http://nickd.org)'s [/mentoring page](http://nickd.org/mentoring), and thought to myself "What a fantastic opportunity this is!" I did a bit more digging into the /mentoring project, and found that the idea came from [Diana Kimball](http://dianakimball.com) whose [original page](http://dianakimball.com/mentoring) kicked it all off. She put her template (along with a few wiki pages with some guidance and advice for mentors) onto Github, and there's already been quite a few people who've taken it up and put up their own pages.

## My experience so far

I've approached a number of the people who've put up pages whose experiences, areas of interest, and mindset seem to overlap my own, and the response I've received back has been amazing. I've set up what might turn into a weekly skype check-in with one mentor, have had some interesting and fantastically helpful email correspondence with a two others, and have had some excellent feedback (and an offer to be put in contact with a further connection) from another. I'm humbled at the willingness of these people to offer their advice, opinions, and guidance to me. If any of you guys are reading this, thanks a bunch for your help and advice—you've all been a much bigger help to me than you know.

I think the whole /mentoring idea is fantastic. As someone who (living on the Gold Coast, Australia) feels noticeably removed from where it seems all the action happens, it's amazingly helpful to be able to connect with, and receive guidance from real people who have been in my shoes, worked through the problems I'm currently facing, and have a broader (and more current) perspective of the industry.

## Spin-offs

I decided that I should put up a mentoring page too—I feel like I'm at the very start of my career still, and really don't know who would want to seek me out as a mentor, but I figured it can't hurt to advertise the fact that I'd be open to people connecting with me if they wanted to (check out [my /mentoring page](http://cobychapple.com/mentoring)). After I tweeted my link, Diana (who started the movement) got in touch saying that she really liked my design portfolio, and asked if I'd like to help put together a dedicated site for the project.

I've wanted to start getting involved with open-source projects for a while now, and while this isn't a piece of software, I'm quite enthusiastic about the opportunity to contribute so directly to a project I genuinely believe in. I don't have a lot of spare time at the moment, but over the next little while I'll be working with Diana when I can to put a face on the project (you can check out a very rough, preliminary outline of the page [here](http://cobychapple.github.com/mentoring-is)).

## Get involved!

If you're in a position where you'd consider making yourself available as a mentor, or if you're someone who's potentially looking to connect with a mentor yourself, check out [the project on github](https://github.com/dianakimball/mentoring) and get stuck in!
