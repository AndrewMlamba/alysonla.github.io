Every major step forward in my life so far has been inspired and encouraged by the mentors I’ve been fortunate enough to have to look up to. I believe that experiences, knowledge, and advice are best shared in ongoing, personal relationships, and to that end it’s important to me to make myself available as a mentor to others.

I’ve had a whole bunch of amazing experiences in my life, and I’d love to share them with you if you’re considering pursuing a similar path.

- I joined [GitHub](https://github.com) as a designer in June 2012. I work remotely from the Gold Coast, Australia.
- Before GitHub, I had successfully made the jump from being employed full-time to working freelance in 2007.
- I’m deeply passionate about quality design—on the web, and elsewhere.
- I’ve worked on countless web development projects, but my design experience extends much further than just pixels and code. I’ve helped businesses with everything from branding and identity design to printed catalogs, publications, packaging and product design.
- I’ve had plenty of practice nursing ideas from abstract thoughts and impulses right through to physical objects and visible results.
- Facilitating groups is something I've been involved with in a variety of contexts for years. I've taught hundreds of people how to dance, presented at local Barcamp meet-ups, and much more.
- I’ve done a ton of travel to some pretty awesome places (Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia, Brazil, the USA, UK and Ireland, France), and seen some pretty mindblowing stuff along the way.
- I’m a hobbyist photographer, among other things.

If you’d like to work together, you can write me a letter responding to the questions below; I’ll write back to all letters I receive in this way within 2 weeks. In response to the most exceptional letters, I’ll propose further correspondence—and in certain cases, an ongoing mentoring relationship.

- Tell me about yourself. How did you become who you are, and who do you want to become?
- What do you hope to gain from our mentoring relationship?
- What excites you the most in the world?
- What’s the best thing you’ve read, watched, or listened to lately?
- What is the work you have done (or other achievements) that you’re most proud of?

Add links to any profiles or projects you’re proud of, and [send it all to me via email](mailto:coby@cobychapple.com).

I look forward to learning together!
