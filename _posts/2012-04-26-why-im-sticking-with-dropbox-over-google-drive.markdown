title: Why I'm Sticking With Dropbox (Over Google Drive)
---

There has been a massive build-up to the release of Google Drive, and while this new offering from the search giant was always going to be a big one, I firmly believe that there's a really convincing argument why Dropbox is a better choice for storing your stuff online: privacy, and retaining rights over your content. I'm no lawyer, but you don't have to be to understand why the implications of Google's privacy policy are probably something you want to avoid.

## What you're giving Google when using Drive

Take a look at Google's [Terms of Service](https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/):

Notice the highlighted portion that reads:

> When you upload or otherwise submit content to our Services, you give Google (and those we work with) a worldwide license to use, host, store, reproduce, modify, create derivative works (such as those resulting from translations, adaptations or other changes we make so that your content works better with our Services), communicate, publish, publicly perform, publicly display and distribute such content.

Do you really want to sign over a worldwide license to use, modify, create derivative works, and publicly display or distribute for every document you upload to Google? My guess is your answer is no.

**Edit:** I've received some criticism for selective highlighting here, and I'd like to make it clear that the following also occurs in Google's terms:

> You retain ownership of any intellectual property rights that you hold in that content. In short, what belongs to you stays yours.

and also:

> The rights you grant in this license are for the limited purpose of operating, promoting, and improving our Services, and to develop new ones.

Despite this, I still feel Google's policy asks for more license than just what is necessary to provide me with the service.

## Dropbox FTW

Now let's see what Dropbox's [terms](https://www.dropbox.com/terms) say.

Their stance essentially appears to be the complete opposite of Google's. Notice the highlighted portion in the above image which reads:

> You retain full ownership to your stuff. We donâ€™t claim any ownership to any of it. These Terms do not grant us any rights to your stuff or intellectual property except for the limited rights that are needed to run the Services, as explained below.

Bravo, Dropbox! Well done for choosing a stance that supports my rights and privacy. That's the kind of attitude more businesses should take.

## Conclusion

Make up your mind yourself, but for me I know I'll be sticking with Dropbox unless something radical changes.
